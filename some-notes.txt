#1. Context (whole implementation in App.js file):
To create Context API, we do it in 3 steps (provider, value, consumer):
1) create a context
2) provide value to child components 
3) consume

step 1:
const SomethingContext = createContext();
createContext is a built-in function in React, it accepts the default value but it's useless as this default cannot change over time, so just leave it empty or put 'null'.

step 2:
Example: the 'return' of App component.
value={{...}} - the object that will contain all the data that we want to make accessible to the child components.

step 3:
Example: the Header, SearchPosts, Results components
useContext(pass entire context object); - this returns the entire value that we pass into the context

#2. PostContext.js file - is about custom provider and hook implemented in App-vs.js file
